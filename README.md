## Status

Curently, the WPF Backend allows to develop applications, but it is still in development. If you want to know in detail the **status**, navigate to the [Status section](Status.md).

## How can I try?

This is really simple. You can test the latest Xamarin Forms WPF on Nightly build. <br>

This project requires two libraries:
- Xamarin.Forms.Platform.WPF: Xamarin Forms WPF Backend
- WpfLightToolkit: It's a collection of helper functions and custom controls for Xamarin.Forms WPF Backend.

To test this project you must add this two Nuget sources in Visual Studio:

- Xamarin.Forms WPF CI: [https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/xamarin-forms-wpf-ci](https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/xamarin-forms-wpf-ci)
- WpfLightToolkit CI: [https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/wpflighttoolkit-ci](https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/wpflighttoolkit-ci)

## Performance

Quality is top of the list of priorities. This means stability and performance first and foremost. Constant testing on a huge volume of samples to achieve this goal.

Follow the style used by the [.NET Foundation](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md), with two primary exceptions:

- We do not use the private keyword as it is the default accessibility level in C#.
- We use hard tabs over spaces. You can change this setting in VS 2015 via Tools > Options and navigating to Text Editor > C# and selecting the "Keep tabs" radio option.
